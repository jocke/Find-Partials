A very simple script that scans through one rails view file looking for 'render partials' and
recursively prints out how they are related.

Usage:
  ./find_partials.rb app/views/<controller>/<action>.rhtml

Limitations
  - Only does extensions "rhtml" and "html.erb"
  - Is not clever enough to figure out partials with "/" in the file names (shared partials)
  - Probably won't work under Windows.

Suggested improvements:
  - Make it work with "/" in the file names
  - More extensions
  - Better OO (PartialFile object?)
  - Better output, graphical output.
  - Smarter error handling.
  - Detection of recursive partials
  - Complete redesign; Scan all partials and map their relationships. Would be good for systems with a lot of shared partials.
